The project was about building a Task Management System application for a small store. The application has the following features:

A public-facing web page where basic contact information can be displayed
An employee login system
A welcome page for logged-in users that displays the username, current date and time, and the user's current level of administration
Easy navigation throughout the application
The ability to display the current user and assign their role at any time
A log out option
The ability to require users to log out or log in at least once per week
The ability to remove employee access as soon as possible
The ability to assign tasks to specific employees
The ability to create tasks with a ticket number, title, body, created and updated dates, and an open or completed status
The ability for employees to view and edit their assigned tasks
The ability for managers and admins to view, edit, and delete all tasks

The project was built using the MERN stack, which is a combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Redux and JWT were also used for authentication and state management.

The project has been deployed to Render.com and can be tested at: https://tms-cbe2.onrender.com/ (username: admin, password: admin123, the login page might not work as the MongoDB cluster could be down)
Some additional features that could be added to the application include an archive for old tasks, the ability to search the archive, the ability to tie the application into financial or billing software, and the ability to save drafts of tasks. 

The backend code for it can be found in the repository called "tms-api" (https://github.com/samsirohi11/tms-api)
